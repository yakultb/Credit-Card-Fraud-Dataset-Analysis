# Credit-Card-Fraud-Dataset-Analysis

This project analyzed a simulated dataset of credit card transactions from January 2019 to December 2020, containing both valid and fraudulent activity. Each transaction included details such as client demographics, merchant information, location data, transaction amounts, and fraud indicators. The unit of analysis was individual credit card transactions, enabling a detailed examination of customer spending behavior.

The dataset provided a diverse set of variables: nominal categories (e.g., Category, City, Gender, Merchant, ZIP, State), discrete variables (e.g., Date of Birth), ordinal variables (e.g., transaction time), and continuous variables (e.g., transaction amount, city population, latitude, longitude, merchant latitude/longitude). By leveraging these data types, the analysis focused on uncovering spending patterns, fraud detection signals, and behavioral insights that could improve understanding of consumer activity.

The primary objective was to evaluate transaction patterns that distinguish fraudulent activity from legitimate transactions and to apply insights that could inform more robust fraud prevention systems. This project highlighted the importance of combining categorical, temporal, and geospatial data to detect anomalies and better protect consumers from fraudulent activity.
